Economist Visualization of the Human Development Index

I used an existing dataset called Economist_Data.csv through Udemy to create a visualization that showed a country's 
Human Development Index relative to their Corruption Perception Index. 

The visualization implies that the higher a country's GDP, the lower the corruption, and therefore correlates to a higher Human Development Index.
