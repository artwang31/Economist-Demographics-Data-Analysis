Economist Visualization Human Development Index

I used an existing dataset called Economist_Data.csv to create a visualization that showed a country's 
Human Development Index relative to their Corruption Perception Index. Conclusion, the visualization implies 
that the higher a country's GDP, the lower the corruption, and the higher the Human Development Index.
